<p>SubSink library allow to stock all the subscriptions of our component that we registered.
    When the component is destroyed, we unsubscribe all the subscription in the ngOnDestoy function.
    Why to use this library ? Because it allow to avoid to use the pipe function and takeUntil operator.
    We gain few lines to avoid to write. (Syntax sugar).
